### How to use:
1. Choose your save file and press "Load file" button
2. Choose weights set you need
3. Choose pal to breed

The app will show you all the pairs of pals in your collection that will give you the right child. Pairs who scored the most points according to the weights set will be at the top of the list.

If you want you can edit weight sets or create a new one.
